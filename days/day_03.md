Updated the repository 
[jupyter_tools](https://github.com/vitalizzare/jupyter_tools)
: added the sctipt to ease accsess to the jupyter subcommands help and
the description of `nb_lint` (the intermediary object betwen notebooks and the `nblint` [linter](https://github.com/alexandercbooth/nblint)).

I've learned how jupyter notebook extensioins are made and how to manage them. 
Sadly to know the lab-extentions are not compatible with those from NB.
It's a pity, cause I'd like to combine some patches from bose of them.
Therefore, I prefer to use jupyter-notebook as opposed to jupyter-lab.
It's just easier to find extention to NB. 
Besides, I couldn't adapt myself to the search and replace system in the Lab.
I tried to use VS Code, but being a linux user it's a paint to make pretty much of the job with a mouse and checkboxes.
I am also annoyed by its constant fussy helpfulness... Am I getting grumpy?

Thanks the `#100DaysOfCode` I've found 
[2048 Game](https://github.com/MahmoudFettal/My-100-days-of-code/blob/main/Day-040/2048.py)
in the repository of other [explorer](https://twitter.com/SmaujX).
I'm curious to write down its logic by myself. 
Made some scratches at the moment.

**Still need the plan to organize myself. Add to this the need to exercise and sleep at night, not during the day.**
