# Day 4
November 28, 2020

[\@SmaujX](https://twitter.com/SmaujX).
It's nice little game to practice programming skill on.<br>

## 2
The day was full of work in vim and I started to appreciate this text editor.
Things like `.` and `&` and `%` that I haven't used before turn out to be very useful when you grasp the logic behind them.

## 3
The crazy thought of the day: _"What if there was an option to disable the ability for lists to respond to index `-1`?"_

## 4
**Will I be able to make a plan and follow it for the next 96 days?**
